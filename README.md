 This contains tiny interesting programs I wrote for homework.

## Helmholtz.py
 This is a neural network with two hidden layers that approximates the solution to the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation ![\nabla^{2} u(x) - \lambda u(x) = f(x)](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cnabla%5E%7B2%7D%20u(x)%20-%20%5Clambda%20u(x)%20%3D%20f(x)).

## LSTM with Lotka-Volterra.py
 This is a simple LSTM that predicts the populations of two species following the Lotka-Volterra equations.

## Red Blood Cell CNN.py
 The pocked Red Blood Cell count has become increasingly utilized as a simple inexpensive test of splenic function<sup>1</sup>. This program uses a CNN that automatically identifies pocked RBC with maximum precision of 95.5% and recall of 70.7%.
